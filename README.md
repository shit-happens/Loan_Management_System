# Loan Management System  

**Project Overview**  
This project was developed as part of **Analyze This '18**, the Annual Data Science Competition organized by American Express, with participation from over 200 teams across IITs. Our team, **Kal-El**, secured the **26th position overall** and ranked **within the top 10 teams at IIT Roorkee**.  

The goal of the project was to deploy a machine learning model capable of predicting whether a bank should approve or reject a loan application based on key credit-rating features. The system is designed to streamline loan management processes and enhance decision-making.
